<h1> History </h1>
<p id="About"> In mid-2014, Doug Fink took his 5 year old daughter to a book reading at the Waltham Public Library. There, he met Clark Sterns, author of the popular children's book "Spaghetti Castle". After a lively book reading, Doug approached Clark and complimented him on his latest work "Finish This Sent..", saying that his use of call-and-response was refreshing in a world where only a modicum of collaborative story telling exists anymore. Clark, an ex-improv comic, completely agreed. Doug proposed that the two work together on a project, and a few weeks later, MadLibz was born.</p>

      <p id="thing">After graduating from Boston College in 2004 with a Bachelor's degree in English, Doug landed a job at Hallmark as a greeting card writer. His cards were popular amongst co-workers, but greeting card critics described him as "too edgy" for the industry. Doug continued to push the envelope, but management disliked his progressive style and encouraged him to be more conservative. After limitations on his creative freedom became to extreme, he decided to leave Hallmark. Doug then took a job as an editor for the Boston Globe. It was during his tenure with the Globe that he began to discover the malleability of language, and developed several techniques for manipulating and substituting different words in a piece of text in order to transform its message in a number of ways. The rest is history.</p>

      <p class="MemberName">Rebecca Sampson</p>
      <p class="MemberTitle">Principle Writer</p>
      <p>Rebecca is our resident hip-hop enthusiast. We found videos of her free-styling on YouTube and were immediately intrigued by her originality. Rebecca's most unique stylistic choice is her tendency to omit various words during her free-styles in order to allow viewers to explore their own creative potential and "fill in the blanks" so to speak. Her creative spirit and collaborative mindset perfectly embody what this site is all about. Since joining the team, Rebecca has been our principle mad lib writer. In her free time she enjoys rock climbing and cooking.</p>
