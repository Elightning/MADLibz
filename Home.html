<h1> Hello, And Welcome to MadLibz</h1>

<!-- Brief description of the site -->
<p>Do you often find yourself finishing other people's sentences? Have you ever muted a television show to overdub the dialog? Do you enjoy the musical stylings of Bobby McFerrin? If you answered yes to either of the first two questions, then MadLibz is right up your alley!</p>
<p>Every day, new mad libs are added to the site for your enjoyment. We hope that in the process of having some fun here, you'll begin to appreciate the art of collaborative story telling. You may be thinking, "But isn't the fun of a mad lib generating a story with no contextual reference and seeing what ridiculous passage pops out?" Well, yes. But the entire process is still collaborative in nature, and regardless of how silly the activity may be, it's still a great example of the fun that can be had by creating something together. After all, it was the great Abraham Lincoln who may have once said, "Peanut butter sandwiches aren't bad. Jelly sandwiches are alright. But peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, well, those are my favorite. Just imagine what other wonders lie in the realm of collaboration."</p>
