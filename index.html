    This web site (MADLibz) provides users the with the opportunity to partake in the traditional game of mad libs in an online environment. The site also contains information regarding the history of its fictious staff and a false means of contact, all for the sake of emulating a real-world site. 

    This is the site's index page. It contains the site's nav bar, the necessary links to ensure that the page functions properly, and the content div container in which the content of the partial html file that is retrieved using fragment IDs in javascript is placed.
